# gh-pages-template

A very basic template repository to get started with GitHub pages.

## How to use this template

1. Click **Use this template** > **Create a new repository** in the top right menu bar
2. Set the new **Repository name** (you will automatically be set as the owner)
    - The address for your new website will be `https://<your username>.github.io/<new repository name>`
    - For example, if you name your repository `portfolio`, the final URL will be `https://<your username>.github.io/portfolio`
    - **Tip**: To make the final URL `https://<your username>.github.io` (without any extra path on the end), name the new repository `<your username>.github.io`
3. Click **Create repository**, and you will be redirected to your new repository (this may take a moment)
4. Go to **Settings** (top menu) > **Pages** (left-hand menu)
5. Under the **Build and deployment** > **Branch** section, change **None** to **main**, then **Save**
6. The site will immediately be published, but will take 1-2 minutes to build.

## Next steps

You now have an `index.html` file into which you can put any HTML code. Additionally, you can uncomment the `script.js` line within the `<head>` tag, and then add any JavaScript you need to that file.
